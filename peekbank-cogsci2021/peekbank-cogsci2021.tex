\begin{abstract}
Developing lexical processing skills - the ability to rapidly process
words and link them to referents in context - is central to children's
early language development. Children's lexical processing is typically
studied in the looking-while-listening paradigm, which measures infants'
fixation of a target object (as opposed to a distracter) after hearing a
target label. In the following paper, we present a large-scale
open-source database of infant and toddler looking-while-listening
studies. The goal of this database is to address theoretical and
methodological challenges in measuring infant vocabulary development
that go beyond the scope of individual studies. We present three
preliminary analyses from the current database: (1) models capturing
item-level variability in infants' lexical processing across age; (2) an
analysis of how a central methodological decision - selecting the time
window of analysis - impacts modeling results; (3) an analysis
demonstrating the link between the age of acquisition of specific words
and children's ability to rapidly and accurately link those words to
their referents. Future efforts will expand the scope of the current
database to advance our understanding of participant-level and
item-level variation in children's vocabulary development.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Across their first years of life, children learn words in their native
tongues at a rapid pace (Braginsky, Yurovsky, Marchman, \& Frank, 2019).
A key part of the word learning process is children's ability to rapidly
process words and link them to relevant meanings in context - often
referred to as lexical processing. Developing lexical processing skills
builds a foundation for children's language development and is
predictive of both linguistic and more general cognitive outcomes later
in life (Bleses, Makransky, Dale, Højen, \& Ari, 2016; Marchman et al.,
2018).

Lexical processing is traditionally studied in
``looking-while-listening'' studies (alternatively referred to as the
intermodal preferential looking procedure) (Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, \&
Marchman, 2008; Hirsh-Pasek, Cauley, Golinkoff, \& Gordon, 1987). In
such studies, infants listen to a sentence prompting a specific referent
(e.g., Look at the dog!) while viewing two images on the screen (e.g.,
an image of a dog - the target image - and an image of a duck - the
distractor image). Infants' lexical processing is measured in terms of
how quickly and accurately infants subsequently fixate the correct
target image after hearing its label. Studies using this basic design
have contributed to our understanding of a wide range of questions in
language development (Golinkoff, Ma, Song, \& Hirsh-Pasek, 2013),
including infants' early noun knowledge (Bergelson \& Swingley, 2012),
phonological representations of words (Swingley \& Aslin, 2000),
prediction during language processing (Lew-Williams \& Fernald, 2007),
and individual differences in language development (Marchman et al.,
2018).

While the looking-while-listening paradigm has been highly fruitful in
advancing understanding of early word knowledge, fundamental questions
remain both about the nature of children's early word knowledge and the
nature of the method itself. One central question relates to
understanding word-specific variability across development, and
generalizing lexical processing on the level of specific words. Most
studies of infant lexical processing focus on generalizing performance
across participants, and are constrained in their ability to provide
generalizations across the item level - the level of specific words.
Generalizing behavior on the level of both participants and items
simultaneously is often difficult in the context of a solitary study,
especially given practical constraints on the number of trials (and
consequently items) tested within a given infant. However, drawing
inferences about item-level variability is key to many questions in how
word learning unfolds, including how properties of the language input
influence lexical development (Goodman, Dale, \& Li, 2008; Roy, Frank,
Decamp, Miller, \& Roy, 2015). One key to meeting this challenge is
having sufficiently large datasets to interrogate variability in lexical
processing on the item level.

A second question relates to evaluating methodological best-practices.
In particular, many fundamental analytic decisions vary substantially
across studies. For example, researchers vary in their decisions
regarding how to select time windows for analysis, modeling how lexical
processing unfolds over time, and the appropriate transformations to
perform on the dependent measure of target fixations (Csibra, Hernik,
Mascaro, Tatone, \& Lengyel, 2016; Fernald et al., 2008; Huang \&
Snedeker, 2020). Establishing best practices regarding analytic
decisions of this kind requires a large database of infant lexical
processing studies, in order to independently test the potential
consequences of a variety of methodological decisions on the
interpretation of study results.

\subsection{Peekbank: A large-scale database of
looking-while-listening-studies}\label{peekbank-a-large-scale-database-of-looking-while-listening-studies}}

What these questions and challenges share is that they are difficult to
answer at the scale of a single looking-while-listening study. In order
to address these questions, we introduce peekbank, a flexible and
reproducible interface to an open database of developmental eye-tracking
studies. Here, we give a brief overview over the key components of the
peekbank project and some initial demonstrations of its utility in
advancing theoretical and methodological questions in the study of
children's lexical processing. The peekbank project (a) collects a large
set of eye-tracking datasets on children's lexical processing, (b)
introduces a data format and processing tools for standardizing
eyetracking data across different data sources, and (c) provides an API
for quickly accessing and analyzing the database.

\caption[Overview of the peekbank data ecosystem]{Overview of the peekbank data ecosystem.}\label{fig:fig_framework_overview}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The Peekbank data framework consists of three libraries that help to
populate and query a relational database (Fig.
\ref{fig:fig_framework_overview}). The \texttt{peekds} library (for the
R language) helps researchers convert and validate existing datasets to
use the relational format used by the database. The \texttt{peekbank}
library (Python) creates a database with the relational schema and
populates it with the standardized datasets produced by \texttt{peekds}.
The database is implemented in MySQL, an industry standard relational
database, which may be accessed by a variety of programming languages
over the internet. The \texttt{peekbankr} library (R) provides an
application programming interface, or API, that provides high-level
abstractions to help researchers run common analysis tasks on the
database.

\hypertarget{data-format-and-processing}{%
\subsection{Data Format and
Processing}\label{data-format-and-processing}}

One of the main challenges in compiling a large-scale eyetracking
dataset is the lack of a shared re-usable data format among labs
conducting individual experiments. Eyetracking methods and researcher
teams vary in their conventions for exporting and structuring data,
rendering the task of integrating datasets from different labs and data
sources difficult. We developed a common, tidy format for the
eyetracking data in peekbank to ease the process of conducting
cross-dataset analyses. The schema of the database (Fig.
\ref{fig:fig_schema}) is sufficiently general to handle heterogeneous
datasets from many studies from many labs, including both manually coded
and automated eyetracking data.

During data import, raw eyetracking datasets are processed to conform to
the peekbank data schema. The centerpiece of the schema is the
aoi\_timepoints table (Fig. \ref{fig:fig_schema}), which records whether
participants looked to the target or distracter stimulus at each
timepoint of a given trial. Additional tables track information about
data sources (datasets), participant characteristics (subjects,
administrations), trial characteristics (trials, trial\_types), stimuli
(stimuli), and raw eyetracking data information (xy\_timepoints,
aoi\_region\_sets). In addition to unifying the data format, we conduct
several additional pre-processing steps to facilitate analyses across
datasets, including resampling observations to a common sampling rate
(40 Hz) and normalizing time relative to the onset of the target label.

The database currently includes 11 datasets comprising N=1233 total
participants, with 23 to 435 participants per dataset (Table 1). The
vast majority of datasets consist of monolingual native English
speakers, with the exception of XX. The datasets span a wide age
spectrum with participants ranging from 8 to 84 months of age, and are
balanced in terms of gender (48\% female). The studies in the current
database vary across a number of dimensions related to design and
methodology. The database includes studies using both manually coded
video recordings or aumotated eyetracking methods to measure children's
gaze behavior. Most studies focused on testing familiar items, but the
database also includes studies in which both familiar words and novel
pseudowords were tested.

\subsection{Predicting Age-Related Changes While Generalizing Across
Items}\label{predicting-age-related-changes-while-generalizing-across-items}}

Following the approach of Mirman (2014), we used growth curve modeling
to assess the timecourse of children's fixations to the target object at
different ages, generalizing across items. Specifically, we predicted
children's proportion of target looking during the critical window from
the interaction between age and four orthogonal polynomial time terms
(linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic). We included by-item and
by-dataset random effects. Figure \ref{fig:age_gca} depicts the model
fit at four different age bins (though not that age was analyzed
continuously in the model).

We found that XXXXX.

In the next analysis, we asked whether properties of a specific item -
in particular, the age of acquisition (AOA) for a particular item -
predict children's lexical processing. Using estimates of the age of
acquisition derived from Wordbank (Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \&
Marchman, 2017) for the target and the distractor word, we modeled
whether earlier-acquired target words are more likely to be fixated
accurately. XX.

\hypertarget{time-window-selection}{%
\subsection{Time Window Selection}\label{time-window-selection}}

Following the approach of Peelle and Van Engen (2020), we conducted a
multiverse-style analysis considering possible time windows for
estimating the effect of age on proportion target looking in linear
mixed-effects models. In this analysis, we fit the same model across a
wide range of combinations of different start times for the critical
window (from XX ms pre target onset to XX ms post target word onset) and
window lengths (ranging from XX ms to XX ms). For each combination of
start time and window length, we fit a linear mixed-effects model
predicting proportion target looking from age, including random
intercepts for participants and words. Since observations were unevenly
distributed across the age range, we also split our data into three age
bins (12-24 months; 24-36 monts; 36-48 months).

Figure \ref{fig:time_window} visualizes the results of the mutliverse
analysis, visualizing the coefficient estimate and its associated
p-value for each combination of window start time and window length. As
expected, proportion target looking increases with age within each age
time bin (as indicated by a positive coefficient estimate). The analysis
shows that the central effect of age on proportion target looking is
emerges under a wide range of window choices. Intriguingly, each age
range shows it's own ``hot spot'' in terms of the largest effects: upper
right for 12-24 mos, bottom middle for 24-36 mos, and bottom right for
36-48 mos. This suggests that researchers may be justified in using
different start times and window sizes for different age ranges, likely
due to the varying pull of familiarity and novelty as learners age.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Many central questions in developmental science face a fundamental data
collection challenge: Studying effects of interest requires a large
amount of observations, but collecting infant data is difficult,
time-intensive, and often limited to a small number of observations per
participant. Recent years have seen a growing effort to build open
source tools and pooling research efforts to meet the challenge of data
collection and aggregation in developmental science (Bergmann et al.,
2018; The ManyBabies Consortium, 2020). Peekbank expands on these
efforts by building an infrastructure for aggregating eyetracking data
across studies, with a particular focus on the looking-while-listening
paradigm. This paper presents a preliminary illustration of some of the
key theoretical and methodological questions the peekbank database aims
to address: understanding item-level variability in children's lexical
processing and providing data-driven guidance on methodological choices.

Diving into more specifics

Future directions and limitations

limitations in language background (almost entirely English,
monolingual)

limitations in participant background (almost entirely WEIRD
participants)

growing the database will address these questions while increasing our
power to answer the key generalization questions of interest

expanding beyond child lexical processing: tools and infrastructure can
in principle be expanded to accommodate any eyetracking paradigm used
with infants and toddlers
