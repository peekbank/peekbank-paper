\begin{abstract}
The ability to rapidly recognize words and link them to referents in
context is central to children's early language development. This
ability, often called word recognition in the developmental literature,
is typically studied in the looking-while-listening paradigm, which
measures infants' fixation on a target object (vs.~a distractor) after
hearing a target label. We present a large-scale, open database of
infant and toddler eye-tracking data from looking-while-listening tasks.
The goal of this effort is to address theoretical and methodological
challenges in measuring vocabulary development. We present two analyses
of the current database (N=1,233): (1) capturing age-related changes in
infants' word recognition while generalizing across item-level
variability and (2) assessing how a central methodological decision --
selecting the time window of analysis -- impacts the reliability of
measurement. Future efforts will expand the scope of the current
database to advance our understanding of participant-level and
item-level variation in children's vocabulary development.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Across their first years of life, children learn words in their native
tongues at a rapid pace (Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman, 2021).
A key part of the word learning process is children's ability to rapidly
process words and link them to relevant meanings -- often referred to as
word recognition. Developing word recognition skills builds a foundation
for children's language development and is predictive of later
linguistic and general cognitive outcomes (Bleses, Makransky, Dale,
Højen, \& Ari, 2016; Marchman et al., 2018).

Word recognition is traditionally studied in the
``looking-while-listening'' paradigm (alternatively referred to as the
intermodal preferential looking procedure; Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, \&
Marchman, 2008; Hirsh-Pasek, Cauley, Golinkoff, \& Gordon, 1987). In
such studies, infants listen to a sentence prompting a specific referent
(e.g., \emph{Look at the dog!}) while viewing two images on the screen
(e.g., an image of a dog -- the target image -- and an image of a duck
-- the distractor image). Infants' word recognition is measured in terms
of how quickly and accurately they fixate on the correct target image
after hearing its label. Studies using this design have contributed to
our understanding of a wide range of questions in language development,
including infants' early noun knowledge, phonological representations of
words, prediction during language processing, and individual differences
in language development (Bergelson \& Swingley, 2012; Golinkoff, Ma,
Song, \& Hirsh-Pasek, 2013; Lew-Williams \& Fernald, 2007; Marchman et
al., 2018; Swingley \& Aslin, 2000).

While the looking-while-listening paradigm has been highly fruitful in
advancing understanding of early word knowledge, fundamental questions
remain both about the trajectory of children's word recognition ability
and the nature of the method itself. One central question is how to
measure developmental change in word recognition. A key idea in the
language learning literature is that processing speed - the ability to
quickly link a word with its referent - supports language learning.
Age-related changes in speed of processing are thought to accelerate
infants' subsequent language learning: the faster infants are able to
process incoming speech input, the better able they become to learn from
their language environment. Similarly, longitudinal analyses have found
that individual differences in word recognition speed predict linguistic
and cognitive outcomes later in childhood {[}e.g., Marchman \& Fernald,
2008{]}. However, measuring increases in the speed and accuracy of word
recognition faces the challenge of distinguishing developmental changes
in word recognition skill from changes in knowledge of specific words.
This problem is particularly thorny in child development, since the
number of items that can be tested within a single session is limited
and items must be selected in an age-appropriate manner (Peter et al.,
2019). Measuring developmental change therefore requires large-scale
datasets with a range of items, in order to generalize age-related
changes across words.

A second question relates to evaluating methodological best practices.
In particular, many fundamental analytic decisions vary substantially
across studies, and different decisions may lead to different inferences
about children's word recognition. For example, researchers vary in how
they select time windows for analysis, transform the dependent measure
of target fixations, and model the time course of word recognition
(Csibra, Hernik, Mascaro, Tatone, \& Lengyel, 2016; Fernald et al.,
2008; Huang \& Snedeker, 2020). This problem is made more complex by the
fact that many of these decisions depend on a variety of design-related
and participant-related factors (e.g., infant age). Establishing best
practices therefore requires a large database of infant word recognition
studies varying across such factors, in order to test the potential
consequences of methodological decisions on study results.

What these two questions share is that they are difficult to answer at
the scale of a single study. To address this challenge, we introduce
\emph{Peekbank} (\url{https://peekbank.stanford.edu/}), a flexible and
reproducible interface to an open database of developmental eye-tracking
studies. The Peekbank project (a) collects a large set of eye-tracking
datasets on children's word recognition, (b) introduces a data format
and processing tools for standardizing eye-tracking data across data
sources, and (c) provides an interface for accessing and analyzing the
database. In the current paper, we give an overview of the key
components of the project and some initial demonstrations of its utility
in advancing theoretical and methodological insights. We report two
analyses using the database and associated tools (N=1,233): (1) a growth
curve analysis modeling age-related changes in infants' word recognition
while generalizing across item-level variability; and (2) a
multiverse-style analysis of how a central methodological decision --
selecting the time window of analysis -- impacts inter-item reliability.

The Peekbank data framework consists of three components: (1) processing
raw experimental datasets; (2) populating a relational database; and (3)
providing an interface to the database (Fig.
\ref{fig:fig_framework_overview}). The \texttt{peekds} library (for the
R language; R Development Core Team, 2020) helps researchers convert and
validate existing datasets to use the relational format of the database.
The \texttt{peekbank} module (Python) creates a database with the
relational schema and populates it with the standardized datasets
produced by \texttt{peekds}. The database is implemented in MySQL, an
industry standard relational database, which may be accessed by a
variety of programming languages over the internet. The
\texttt{peekbankr} library (R) provides an application programming
interface, or API, that offers high-level abstractions for accessing
data in Peekbank.

\subsection{Data Format and
Processing}\label{data-format-and-processing}}

One of the main challenges in compiling a large-scale eye-tracking
dataset is the lack of a shared re-usable data format across individual
experiments. Researcher conventions for structuring data vary, as do the
technical specifications of different devices, rendering the task of
integrating datasets from different labs and data sources difficult. We
developed a common, tidy format for the eye-tracking data in Peekbank to
ease the process of conducting cross-dataset analyses (Wickham et al.,
2019). The schema of the database is sufficiently general to handle
heterogeneous datasets, including both manually coded and automated
eye-tracking data.

During data import, raw eye-tracking datasets are processed to conform
to the Peekbank data schema. The centerpiece of the schema is the
\texttt{aoi\textunderscore timepoints} table (Fig.
\ref{fig:fig_framework_overview}), which records whether participants
looked to the target or the distractor stimulus at each timepoint of a
given trial. Additional tables track information about data sources,
participant characteristics, trial characteristics, stimuli, and raw
eye-tracking data. In addition to unifying the data format, we conduct
several additional pre-processing steps to facilitate analyses across
datasets. First, we normalize time relative to the onset of the target
label, since the main goal is to assess participants' fixation of the
target image in response to hearing iits corresponding label. Second, we
resample observations to a common sampling rate (40 Hz), in order to
ease data visualization and analysis. Where necessary (e.g., if the
original data was sampled at 30 Hz), observations are interpolated by
selecting the look location at the nearest time point in the original
data.

\hypertarget{current-data-sources}{%
\subsection{Current Data Sources}\label{current-data-sources}}

The database currently includes 15 looking-while-listening datasets
comprising N=1320 total participants (Table 1). Most datasets (10 out of
11 total) consist of data from monolingual native English speakers. They
span a wide age spectrum with participants ranging from 9 to 70 months
of age, and are balanced in terms of gender (46\% female). The datasets
vary across a number of dimensions related to design and methodology,
and include studies using manually coded video recordings and automated
eye-tracking methods (e.g., Tobii, EyeLink) to measure gaze behavior.
Most studies focused on testing familiar items, but the database also
includes studies with novel pseudowords. All data (and accompanying
references) are openly available on the Open Science Framework
(\url{https://osf.io/pr6wu/}).

\caption{Average proportion target looking in each dataset.} 
\end{table}

In general, participants demonstrated robust, above-chance word
recognition in each dataset (with chance being 0.5). Table 2 shows the
average proportion of target looking within a standard critical window
of 300-2000ms after the onset of the label for each dataset (Swingley \&
Aslin, 2000). The number of unique target labels and their associated
accuracy vary widely across datasets (Figure
\ref{fig:peekbank_item_vis}). Proportion target looking was generally
higher for familiar words (M = 65.9\%, 95\% CI = {[}65\%, 66.7\%{]})
than for novel words learned during the experiment (M = 59.3\%, 95\% CI
= {[}57.8\%, 60.8\%{]}).

\subsection{Predicting Age-Related Changes While Generalizing Across
Items}\label{predicting-age-related-changes-while-generalizing-across-items}}

Developmental changes in word recognition have been a central issue
since early investigations of eye-tracking techniques (Fernald, Pinto,
Swingley, Weinberg, \& McRoberts, 1998). Children's speed and accuracy
of word recognition increases across early childhood, yet measuring
these increases presents an item selection puzzle for researchers: Words
that are appropriate for an 18-month-old will be too easy for a
three-year-old; those that are appropriate for a three-year-old will be
difficult for the 18-month-old. Failure to choose appropriate test items
can even lead to spurious conclusions about development (Peter et al.,
2019).

This issue is familiar in psychometrics: test developers interested in
measuring across a wide range of a particular latent ability must choose
items appropriate for different abilities. One solution is to use data
from a bank of questions that have been taken by test-takers of a range
of abilities, and then use item-response theory models to create
different test versions appropriate for different ability ranges
(Embretson \& Reise, 2000). Such tests can then be used to extract
estimates of developmental change that are independent of individual
tests and their particular items.

Peekbank provides the appropriate large-scale database for estimating
these item-independent developmental changes and designing
age-appropriate tests in the future. Here we show a proof of concept by
providing an estimate of the item-independent growth of word recognition
accuracy across development. We take advantage of the equivalence
between item response theory and linear mixed-effects models (LMMs; De
Boeck et al., 2011), using LMMs to model the trajectory of word
recognition across age. We follow the approach of Mirman (2014) and use
growth curve LMMs to predict the time course of recognition.
Specifically, we predicted children's proportion of target looking
during an early window of time (0-1500ms, chosen to avoid modeling
declines in looking later in the trial), using an empirical logit
transform on the proportion of target looking to allow the use of linear
(rather than logistic) regression models. Our predictors were time after
word onset and age, and we additionally included polynomial functions of
time (up to fourth order) and quadratic effects of age, as well as their
interactions. We subtracted all intercepts to force fits to start at a
baseline of 0 (chance performance) at time zero. As a random effect
structure, we included by-item, by-subject, and by-dataset random
intercepts; though a larger random effect structure could be justified
by the data, the size of the dataset precluded fitting these. The random
effect structure allows us to model word recognition while generalizing
across items and participants.

Figure \ref{fig:age_gca} depicts the results of this analysis. Panel A
shows the mean empirical word recognition curves for four age groups,
along with fitted model performance. Although model fits are acceptable,
developmental change appears irregular -- for example, 12- to
24-month-olds show slightly earlier recognition than 24- to
36-month-olds. This pattern is likely an artifact of averaging across
datasets with substantially different items and structures. Panel B
shows model predictions for the population level of each random effect
-- our best estimates of the latent ability structure. Here we see
continuous increases in both speed (point at which the curve rises) and
accuracy (asymptote of the curve) across ages, though this developmental
trend decelerates (consistent with other work on reaction time
development; Frank, Lewis, \& MacDonald, 2016; Kail, 1991). This proof
of concept suggests that Peekbank can be used to model developmental
change over multiple years, overcoming the limitations of individual
datasets.

\label{fig:time_window}
\end{SCfigure*}

In our second analysis, we address a common analytic decision facing
researchers: how to summarize time course data into a single measure of
accuracy. Taking a similar approach to that of Peelle \& Van Engen
(2020), we conducted a multiverse-style analysis considering possible
time windows researchers might select (Steegen, Tuerlinckx, Gelman, \&
Vanpaemel, 2016). Our multiverse analysis focuses on the reliability of
participants' response to familiar words by measuring the subject-level
inter-item correlation (IIC) for proportion of looking at familiar
targets. The time windows selected by researchers varies substantially
in the literature, with some studies analyzing shorter time windows
between 300ms and 1800-2000ms post-target onset (Fernald et al., 2008;
Swingley \& Aslin, 2000), and others using longer time windows extending
to approximately 3000-4000ms (especially with younger infants; e.g.,
Bergelson \& Swingley, 2012). We thus examined a broad range of window
start times ranging from 300ms pre-target onset to 1500ms post-target
onset and window end times ranging from 0ms to 4000ms post-target onset.
For each combination of window start time and end time with a minimum
window duration of 50ms, we calculated participants' average inter-item
correlation for proportion of looking at familiar targets (mean IIC).
Since observations were unevenly distributed across the age range, and
because children likely show a varying response to familiar items as
they age (often motivating different window choices), we split our data
into four age bins (12-24, 24-36, 36-48, and 48-60 months). While it is
an open question what space of possible windows will yield the greatest
reliability, we expect to see low reliability (i.e.~0) in windows that
start before target onset and in windows that end within 300ms
post-target onset, before participants can execute a response.

Results from this multiverse analysis are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:time_window}, where each colored pixel represents the mean IIC
for proportion of looking to familiar targets for a specific combination
of window start and end time. The analysis shows that IIC is positive
(red) under a wide range of sensible window choices. IIC is relatively
low however, especially for the youngest age group, suggesting that
individual items carry only limited shared signal regarding children's
underlying ability. It may be the case that even averaging many such
trials does not yield highly reliable measures of individual
differences, although some multi-trial paradigms are exceptions to this
generalization (Fernald et al., 2008).

Intriguingly, however, late end times and long overall window lengths
show the greatest reliability. Shorter windows (e.g., 300-2000ms, as we
used above) likely maximize absolute recognition performance by fitting
the peak of the recognition curve, but simultaneously lower reliability
by failing to include all relevant data. Especially for older children,
the maximal IICs were found with windows that started between 500 and
1000ms and ended between 3000 and 4000ms, windows usually reserved for
younger children. This finding is sensible from a psychometric
perspective -- averaging more timepoints (even if some contain limited
signal) increases reliability and reduces variation. Thus, researchers
interested in better measurement of individual variation or condition
differences should consider using longer windows by default.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Theoretical progress in understanding child development requires rich
datasets, but collecting child data is expensive, difficult, and
time-intensive. Recent years have seen a growing effort to build open
source tools and pool research efforts to meet the challenge of building
a cumulative developmental science (Bergmann et al., 2018; Frank,
Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman, 2017; The ManyBabies Consortium,
2020). The Peekbank project expands on these efforts by building an
infrastructure for aggregating eye-tracking data across studies, with a
specific focus on the looking-while-listening paradigm. The goals of the
database are to ask theory-driven questions about the development of
word knowledge and to establish methodological best-practices in infant
eye-tracking methods. This paper presents an illustration of some of the
key theoretical and methodological questions that can be addressed using
Peekbank: generalizing across item-level variability in children's word
recognition and providing data-driven guidance on choosing windows of
analysis.

Our first analysis shows that Peekbank can be used to model
item-independent changes in the speed and accuracy of word recognition
across development. Children showed age-related increases in the speed
of word recognition across one to five years of age, extending past
foundational work (e.g., Fernald et al., 1998) by showing that these
word processing gains generalize across items and are not only
attributable to word-specific gains in processing speed. The second
analysis demonstrates how Peekbank can be used to make data-driven
analytic decisions, focusing on the choice of time windows for analysis.
In looking-while-listening studies, researchers often choose a
relatively short time window of roughly 300-1800 or 2000ms (Fernald et
al., 2008), with the justification that eye movements occurring after
this window may no longer be related to the target label (Swingley \&
Aslin, 2000). Our results recommend that researchers consider increasing
the size of the time window for analyzing target fixations (at least for
familiar words) to maximize the consistent signal in children's target
fixations.

There are a number of limitations surrounding the current scope of the
database. A priority in future work will be to expand the size of the
database. With 15 datasets currently available in the database,
idiosyncrasies of particular designs and condition manipulations still
have substantial influence on modeling results. Expanding the set of
distinct datasets will allow us to increase the number of observations
per item across datasets, leading to more robust generalizations across
item-level variability. The current database is also limited by the
relatively homogeneous background of its participants, both with respect
to language (almost entirely monolingual native English speakers) and
cultural background (all but one dataset comes from WEIRD populations;
Muthukrishna et al., 2020). Increasing the diversity of participant
backgrounds and languages will expand the scope of the generalizations
we can form about child word recognition.

Finally, while the current database is focused on studies of word
recognition, the tools and infrastructure developed in the project can
in principle be used to accommodate any eye-tracking paradigm, opening
up new avenues for insights into cognitive development. Gaze behavior
has been at the core of many of the key advances in our understanding of
infant cognition. Aggregating large datasets of infant looking behavior
in a single, openly-accessible format promises to bring a fuller picture
of infant cognitive development into view.
